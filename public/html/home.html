<h2>Some Notes</h2>

<ul>

<li>Tuesday classes will be lectures and tutorials. Lectures are recorded and available <a ui-sref="main.lectures">here</a></li>
<li>Thursday classes will be lab sessions: this is your chance to work around others solving the same problems, with supervised help</li>
<li>Assignments go out on Tuesdays, and are due on Tuesdays. Late assignments will be accepted until the Thursday class after which they were due for 75% credit, unless otherwise cleared.</li>
<li>This is a first run. The course structure will be fluid; if something doesnâ€™t work, or is not doable in the given time, we will adapt. Do not think rules are set in stone.</li>
